menuconfig DMABUF_HEAPS_DEFERRED_FREE
	bool "DMA-BUF heaps deferred-free library"
	help
	  Choose this option to enable the DMA-BUF heaps deferred-free library.

menuconfig DMABUF_HEAPS_PAGE_POOL
	bool "DMA-BUF heaps page-pool library"
	help
	  Choose this option to enable the DMA-BUF heaps page-pool library.

	depends on DMABUF_HEAPS
	select DMABUF_HEAPS_PAGE_POOL
	help
	  Choose this option to enable the system dmabuf heap. The system heap
	  is backed by pages from the buddy allocator. If in doubt, say Y.

config DMABUF_HEAPS_CMA
	tristate "DMA-BUF CMA Heap"
	depends on DMABUF_HEAPS && DMA_CMA
	help
	  Choose this option to enable dma-buf CMA heap. This heap is backed
	  by the Contiguous Memory Allocator (CMA). If your system has these
	  regions, you should say Y here.

        tristate "DMA-BUF System Heap"
        depends on DMABUF_HEAPS
        help
          Choose this option to enable the system dmabuf heap. The system heap
          is backed by pages from the buddy allocator. If in doubt, say Y.

        help
          Choose this option to enable heap refill. Pool has high water and low
          water. After executing dmabuf alloc and detecting that the current pool
          size is lower than the low water, the refill thread is started. The
          refill worker thread allocates pages to fill in the pool, and stops
          filling when the pool size is higher than the high water mark.

        help
          Choose this option to enable the mtk debug heap.
          This debug tool can be use to dump dmabuf usage for users
          If you want use it, say Y if you are not using GKI
          say m and add ko into your system for GKI.
